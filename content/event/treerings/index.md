title: Master thesis - Unlocking the power of tree-ring data for modelling forest carbon dynamics

# event: Wowchemy Conference
# event_url: https://example.org

location: Institute of Geography, University of Bern and WSL Birmensdorf

#   city: Stanford

# summary: Modelling biophysical limits to forest production
# abstract: "Vegetation models underlying climate projections predict that forests will offset a large proportion of human CO2 emissions, but these models omit important biophysical controls of tree growth. Based on a mechanistic vegetation model, you will investigate how to implement such biophysical controls and how these might impact carbon fixation by forests in the future."

**Context**: Tree-ring data is available in spades but has only marginally been used in the context of climate impacts on the land carbon cycle.

**Aim**: This project will develop methods to use information of annual tree-ring anomalies for constraining modelled tree growth and forest dynamics in response to climate variability.

**Methods**: Vegetation modelling (BiomeEP model) and model-data evaluation and calibration.

**Main supervision:** Prof. Dr. Benjamin Stocker
**Co-supervision:** Dr. Stefan Klesse, WSL Birmensdorf
