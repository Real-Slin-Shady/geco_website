Evaluating ALEXI:

In addition to EC measurements, use (ecosystem-level upscaled) sapflow data to evaluate ALEXI ET, focusing on temporal patterns. With ECOSTRESS-ALEXI, we can evaluate also spatial patterns, and sapflow measurements can be taken from sites that are located at slopes (which is often not the case for EC sites)
