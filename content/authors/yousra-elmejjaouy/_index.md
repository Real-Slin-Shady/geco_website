I am a postdoc at the University of Bern, Switzerland. My PhD thesis was jointly directed by the University of Li√®ge in Belgium and the University Mohammed VI Polytechnic in Morocco, where I worked on multiscale phosphorus monitoring in soil-plant system using spectroscopic proximal sensing and UAV-based multispectral imaging. My current research focuses on drone-based imagery for monitoring and predicting vegetation water stress across landscape-scale gradients.
