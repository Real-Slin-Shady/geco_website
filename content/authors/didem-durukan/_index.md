I am a computer engineer and currently I am pursuing my masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at University of Zurich. My current research focus is to implement predictive models that can predict future drought impact, and capture spatial and temporal dependencies between environmental factors and droughts. 

Besides my passion for Earth Observation field, in my free time I like to do photography, and lots of sports.

I am really thrilled and excited to be in the field where I can use my data science skills to create an impact in world!
