I am a student in the Master’s Program of Climate Sciences at the UniBern and currently, I’m writing my thesis, which is a shared project of GECO and EAWAG. For my project, I model access to safely managed drinking water services in different countries, such as Laos and Nigeria and check how well such models could replace on-the-ground surveys.
 
Apart from the academic context, I enjoy doing sports, such as judo or dancing. Also, with the goal of spending less time on my smartphone, I started reading novels, which has been very much fun so far.
