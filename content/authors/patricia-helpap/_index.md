I am a MSc Climate Science student at the Oeschger Center for Climate Change Research, University of Berne. For my thesis I am looking at droughts in the last millenium by analysing CWD (cumulative water deficit) from climate model (ModE-Sim) output. My background is in Environmental Earth Science.

Aside from academics, I enjoy the great outdoors, playing music with friends and reading.
