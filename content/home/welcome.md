The GECO Group is a research group at the University of Bern, that belongs to the Insitute of Geography and the Oeschger Center for Climate Research. 

We are a team of researchers driven by our curiosity to understand how the terrestrial biosphere operates. 

We develop capacity to detect, quantify, and predict responses of plants and ecosystems to climate change and forecast the impact of extremes.

Our science enables a better understanding of the integrity and function of the natural world under pressure - key to creating a sustainable future.
