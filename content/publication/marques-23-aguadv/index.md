abstract: Abstract While enhanced tree growth over the last decades has been reported
  in forests across the globe, it remains unclear whether it drives persistent biomass
  increases of forest stands, particularly in mature forests. Enhanced tree growth
  and stand-level biomass are often linked with a simultaneous increase in density-driven
  mortality and a reduction in tree longevity. Identifying empirical evidence regarding
  the balance between these processes is challenging due to the confounding effects
  of stand history, management, and environmental changes. Here, we investigate the
  link between growth and biomass via the negative relationship between average tree
  size and stand density (tree number per area). We find increasing stand density
  for a given mean tree size in unmanaged closed-canopy forests in Switzerland over
  the past six decades and a positive relationship between tree growth and stand density
  across forest plots—qualitatively consistent with our simulations using a mechanistic,
  cohort-resolving ecosystem model (BiomeE). Model simulations show that, in the absence
  of other disturbances, enhanced tree growth persistently increases biomass stocks
  despite simultaneous decreases in carbon residence time and tree longevity. However,
  the magnitude of simulated biomass changes for a given growth enhancement critically
  depends on the shape of the mortality functions. Our analyses reconcile reports
  of growth-induced reductions of tree longevity with model predictions of persistent
  biomass increases, and with our finding of trends toward denser forests in response
  to growth—also in mature stands.
