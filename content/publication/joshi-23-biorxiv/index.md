abstract: The resilience of biodiverse forests to climate change depends on an interplay
  of adaptive processes operating at multiple temporal and organizational scales.
  These include short-term acclimation of physiological processes like photosynthesis
  and respiration, mid-term changes in forest structure due to competition, and long-term
  changes in community composition arising from competitive exclusion and genetic
  trait evolution. To investigate the roles of diversity and adaptation for forest
  resilience, we present Plant-FATE, a parsimonious eco-evolutionary vegetation model.
  Tested with data from a hyperdiverse Amazonian terra-firme forest, our model accurately
  predicts multiple emergent ecosystem properties characterizing forest structure
  and function. Under elevated CO2 conditions, we predict an increase in productivity,
  leaf area, and aboveground biomass, with the magnitude of this increase declining
  in nutrient-deprived soils if trees allocate more carbon to the rhizosphere to overcome
  nutrient limitation. Furthermore, increased aboveground productivity leads to greater
  competition for light and drives a shift in community composition towards fast-growing
  but short-lived species characterized by lower wood densities. Such a transition
  reduces the carbon residence time of woody biomass, dampening carbon-sink strength
  and potentially rendering the Amazon Forest more vulnerable to future climatic extreme
  events.
