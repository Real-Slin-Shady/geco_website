abstract: Climate change is shifting the growing seasons of plants, affecting species
  performance and biogeochemical cycles. Yet how the timing of autumn leaf senescence
  in Northern Hemisphere forests will change remains uncertain. Using satellite, ground,
  carbon flux, and experimental data, we show that early-season and late-season warming
  have opposite effects on leaf senescence, with a reversal occurring after the year’s
  longest day (the summer solstice). Across 84% of the northern forest area, increased
  temperature and vegetation activity before the solstice led to an earlier senescence
  onset of, on average, 1.9 ± 0.1 days per °C, whereas warmer post-solstice temperatures
  extended senescence duration by 2.6 ± 0.1 days per °C. The current trajectories
  toward an earlier onset and slowed progression of senescence affect Northern Hemisphere–wide
  trends in growing-season length and forest productivity.
