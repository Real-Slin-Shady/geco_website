abstract: The advent of abundant Earth observation data enables the development of
  novel predictive methods for forecasting climate impacts on the state and health
  of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we predict the spatial and temporal variations
  of land surface reflectance and vegetation greenness, measuring the density of green
  vegetation and active foliage area, conditioned on current and past weather and
  the local topography. We train two alternative recurrent deep learning models that
  combine Long Short-Term Memory cells with convolutional layers (ConvLSTM) for forecasting
  the spatially resolved deviation of surface reflectance across a heterogeneous landscape
  from a specified initial state. Using data from diverse ecosystems and land cover
  types across Europe and following a standardized model evaluation framework (EarthNet2021
  Challenge), our results indicate increased performance in predicting surface greenness
  during extreme drought events of the models presented here, compared to currently
  published benchmarks. This demonstrates how deep learning methods for optical Earth
  observation time series enable an early-warning of vegetation responses to the impacts
  of climatic extreme events, such as the drought-related loss of green foliage.
