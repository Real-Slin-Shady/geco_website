abstract: The global carbon and water cycles are governed by the coupling of CO2 and
  water vapour exchanges through the leaves of terrestrial plants, controlled by plant
  adaptations to balance carbon gains and hydraulic risks. We introduce a trait-based
  optimality theory that unifies the treatment of stomatal responses and biochemical
  acclimation of plants to environments changing on multiple timescales. Tested with
  experimental data from 18 species, our model successfully predicts the simultaneous
  decline in carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity
  during progressive soil drought. It also correctly predicts the dependencies of
  gas exchange on atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, temperature and CO2. Model
  predictions are also consistent with widely observed empirical patterns, such as
  the distribution of hydraulic strategies. Our unified theory opens new avenues for
  reliably modelling the interactive effects of drying soil and rising atmospheric
  CO2 on global photosynthesis and transpiration.
