abstract: Mechanistic vegetation models serve to estimate terrestrial carbon fluxes
  and climate impacts on ecosystems across diverse biotic and abiotic conditions.
  Systematically informing them with data is key for enhancing their predictive accuracy
  and estimate uncertainty. Here we present the Simulating Optimal FUNctioning rsofun
  R package, providing a computationally efficient and parallelizable implementation
  of the P-model for site-scale simulations of ecosystem photosynthesis, complemented
  with functionalities for Bayesian model-data integration and estimation of parameters
  and uncertainty. We provide a use case to demonstrate the package functionalities
  for modelling ecosystem gross CO2 uptake at one flux measurement site, including
  model sensitivity analysis, Bayesian parameter calibration, and prediction uncertainty
  estimation. rsofun lowers the bar of entry to ecosystem modelling and model-data
  integration and serves as an open access resource for model development and dissemination.
