abstract: Responses of the terrestrial biosphere to rapidly changing environmental
  conditions are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. In an effort
  to reduce this uncertainty, a wide range of global change experiments have been
  conducted that mimic future conditions in terrestrial ecosystems, manipulating CO2,
  temperature, nutrient and water availability. Syntheses of results across experiments
  provide a more general sense of ecosystem responses to global change, and help to
  discern the influence of background conditions such as climate and vegetation type
  in determining global change responses. Several independent syntheses of published
  data have yielded distinct databases for specific objectives. Such parallel, uncoordinated
  initiatives carry the risk of producing redundant data collection efforts and have
  led to contrasting outcomes without clarifying the underlying reason for divergence.
  These problems could be avoided by creating a publicly available, updatable, curated
  database. Here, we report on a global effort to collect and curate 57,089 treatment
  responses across 3,644 manipulation experiments at 1,145 sites, simulating elevated
  CO2, warming, nutrient addition and precipitation changes. In the resulting Manipulation
  Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database, effects of experimental global
  change drivers on carbon and nutrient cycles are included, as well as ancillary
  data such as background climate, vegetation type, treatment magnitude, duration,
  and, unique to our database, measured soil properties. Our analysis of the database
  indicates that most experiments are short-term (one or few growing seasons), conducted
  in the USA, Europe or China, and that the most abundantly reported variable is aboveground
  biomass. We provide the most comprehensive multifactor global change database to
  date, enabling the research community to tackle open research questions, vital to
  global policymaking. The MESI database, freely accessible at doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7153253,
  opens new avenues for model evaluation and synthesis-based understanding of how
  global change affects terrestrial biomes. We welcome contributions to the database
  on GitHub.
