  Ecosystem manipulative experiments are one of the most powerful tools to understand
  terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change because they measure real responses
  in real ecosystems. However, their scope is limited in space and time due to cost
  and labour intensity. This makes generalising results from such experiments difficult,
  which creates a conceptual gap between local scale process understanding and global
  scale future predictions. Recent efforts have seen results from such experiments
  used in combination with dynamic global vegetation models, most commonly to evaluate
  model predictions under global change drivers. However, there is much more potential
  in combining models and experiments. Here, we discuss the value and potential of
  a workflow for using ecosystem experiments together with process-based models to
  enhance the potential of both. We suggest that models can be used prior to the start
  of an experiment to generate hypotheses, identify data needs and in general guide
  experimental design. Models, when adequately constrained with observations, can
  also predict variables which are difficult to measure frequently or at all, and
  together with the data can provide a more complete picture of ecosystem states.
  Finally, models can be used to help generalise the experimental results in space
  and time, by providing a framework in which process understanding derived from site-level
  experiments can be incorporated. We also discuss the potential for using manipulative
  experiments together with models in formalised model-data integration frameworks
  for parameter estimation and model selection, a path made possible by the increasing
  number of ecosystem experiments and diverse observation streams. The ideas presented
  here can provide a roadmap to future experiment - model studies.textless/ptextgreater
