abstract: Leaf phenology is key for regulating total growing-season mass and energy
  fluxes. Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across
  Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby
  end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates
  and negatively with growing-season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations
  have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature
  carbon (C) sink saturation—with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology
  projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multidecadal ground
  and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and
  EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend
  towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet—in spite
  of the negative Anet–EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This finding is
  robust against the use of diverse observations and models. Results indicate that
  acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf longevity
  or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading to a
  more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation
  CO2 uptake season over time.
