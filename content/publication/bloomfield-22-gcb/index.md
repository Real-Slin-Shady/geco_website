abstract: Abstract Gross primary production (GPP) by terrestrial ecosystems is a key
  quantity in the global carbon cycle. The instantaneous controls of leaf-level photosynthesis
  are well established, but there is still no consensus on the mechanisms by which
  canopy-level GPP depends on spatial and temporal variation in the environment. The
  standard model of photosynthesis provides a robust mechanistic representation for
  C3 species; however, additional assumptions are required to “scale up” from leaf
  to canopy. As a consequence, competing models make inconsistent predictions about
  how GPP will respond to continuing environmental change. This problem is addressed
  here by means of an empirical analysis of the light use efficiency (LUE) of GPP
  inferred from eddy covariance carbon dioxide flux measurements, in situ measurements
  of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and remotely sensed estimates of the
  fraction of PAR (fAPAR) absorbed by the vegetation canopy. Focusing on LUE allows
  potential drivers of GPP to be separated from its overriding dependence on light.
  GPP data from over 100 sites, collated over 20 years and located in a range of biomes
  and climate zones, were extracted from the FLUXNET2015 database and combined with
  remotely sensed fAPAR data to estimate daily LUE. Daytime air temperature, vapor
  pressure deficit, diffuse fraction of solar radiation, and soil moisture were shown
  to be salient predictors of LUE in a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The
  same model design was fitted to site-based LUE estimates generated by 16 terrestrial
  ecosystem models. The published models showed wide variation in the shape, the strength,
  and even the sign of the environmental effects on modeled LUE. These findings highlight
  important model deficiencies and suggest a need to progress beyond simple “goodness
  of fit” comparisons of inferred and predicted carbon fluxes toward an approach focused
  on the functional responses of the underlying dependencies.
