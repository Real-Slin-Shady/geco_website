abstract: Summary Land carbon dynamics in temperate and boreal ecosystems are sensitive
  to environmental change. Accurately simulating gross primary productivity (GPP)
  and its seasonality is key for reliable carbon cycle projections. However, significant
  biases have been found in early spring GPP simulations of northern forests, where
  observations often suggest a later resumption of photosynthetic activity than predicted
  by models. Here, we used eddy covariance-based GPP estimates from 39 forest sites
  that differ by their climate and dominant plant functional types. We used a mechanistic
  and an empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model to investigate the magnitude and
  environmental controls of delayed springtime photosynthesis resumption (DSPR) across
  sites. We found DSPR reduced ecosystem LUE by 30â€“70% at many, but not all site-years
  during spring. A significant depression of LUE was found not only in coniferous
  but also at deciduous forests and was related to combined high radiation and low
  minimum temperatures. By embedding cold-acclimation effects on LUE that considers
  the delayed effects of minimum temperatures, initial model bias in simulated springtime
  GPP was effectively resolved. This provides an approach to improve GPP estimates
  by considering physiological acclimation and enables more reliable simulations of
  photosynthesis in northern forests and projections in a warming climate.
