abstract: Theory predicts that rising CO2 increases global photosynthesis, a process
  known as CO2 fertilization, and that this is responsible for much of the current
  terrestrial carbon sink. The estimated magnitude of the historic CO2 fertilization,
  however, differs by an order of magnitude between long-term proxies, remote sensing-based
  estimates and terrestrial biosphere models. Here we constrain the likely historic
  effect of CO2 on global photosynthesis by combining terrestrial biosphere models,
  ecological optimality theory, remote sensing approaches and an emergent constraint
  based on global carbon budget estimates. Our analysis suggests that CO2 fertilization
  increased global annual terrestrial photosynthesis by 13.5 ± 3.5% or 15.9 ± 2.9 PgC
  (mean ± s.d.) between 1981 and 2020. Our results help resolve conflicting estimates
  of the historic sensitivity of global terrestrial photosynthesis to CO2 and highlight
  the large impact anthropogenic emissions have had on ecosystems worldwide.
