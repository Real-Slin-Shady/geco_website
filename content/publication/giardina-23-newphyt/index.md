abstract: Summary Accounting for water limitation is key to determining vegetation
  sensitivity to drought. Quantifying water limitation effects on evapotranspiration
  (ET) is challenged by the heterogeneity of vegetation types, climate zones and vertically
  along the rooting zone. Here, we train deep neural networks using flux measurements
  to study ET responses to progressing drought conditions. We determine a water stress
  factor (fET) that isolates ET reductions from effects of atmospheric aridity and
  other covarying drivers. We regress fET against the cumulative water deficit, which
  reveals the control of whole-column moisture availability. We find a variety of
  ET responses to water stress. Responses range from rapid declines of fET to 10%
  of its water-unlimited rate at several savannah and grassland sites, to mild fET
  reductions in most forests, despite substantial water deficits. Most sensitive responses
  are found at the most arid and warm sites. A combination of regulation of stomatal
  and hydraulic conductance and access to belowground water reservoirs, whether in
  groundwater or deep soil moisture, could explain the different behaviors observed
  across sites. This variety of responses is not captured by a standard land surface
  model, likely reflecting simplifications in its representation of belowground water
  storage.
